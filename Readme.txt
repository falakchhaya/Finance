-------------Objectives--------------

----- Broader View
-- To learn to monitor and manage my finances better on my own.
-- If this project works well, this can be open-sourced/scaled up.


----- Short term
-- Fetch and store historical data from KiteConnect (Zerodha).
-- Explore the markers/indicators from that.
-- Explore ML algos / NN architechtures and build on that to predict the price or direction.
        -- including sentiment would be an organic extension.

---- Another one
-- fetch the mf holdings from the mf name.
-- objective is to combine equity and mf holdings to see your actual holdings in a particular stock.
-- This would give better insight in truly diversifying the portfolio.
