-------------Objectives--------------

----- Broader
-- To learn to monitor and manage my finances better on my own.
-- If this project works well, this can be open-sourced/scaled up.


----- Short term
-- fetch the mf holdings from the mf name.
-- objective is to combine equity and mf holdings to see your actual holdings in a particular stock.
-- This would give better insight in truly diversifying the portfolio.
